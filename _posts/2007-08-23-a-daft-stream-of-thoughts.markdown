Current fascination: Douglas' Coupland trains, endless carriages with streams of (un)coherent 
words. Filling pages, filling minds, creating self-linked associations. Nice phrases without verbs
whatsoever. Or a careless use of past tense for some evil description of the day. In the mean time,
I should not forget to regularly implement some disorder in my otherwise much to coherent musings.
But it's never too late, I mean the changeability of the Web 2.0 expands even to the history of the
written word; leads me to the notion of being able to rewrite and control history. Who controls the
past controls the future, who controls the present controls the past (Georgie O.).
