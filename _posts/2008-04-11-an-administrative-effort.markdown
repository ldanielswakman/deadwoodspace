I love to be satisfied about dead wood author for years, has to be said. Also, the aesthetics of
sentencing like Douglas Coupland. I mean, the guy's a god.

Depict certified despising... architectuur > centerparks, zuipen, drinken, pyromanie, porno. All
big stories and a pokerface.

The communal anonimity of rush hour; that is, accepted behaviour to ignore.

Efficiency of thoughtime? Obviously, there is no such thing. But writing down does concentrate you.
A pace to be thorough, that would be nice. A focus. Not by trying (too) hard, but a - clich√© - 
state of mind.
