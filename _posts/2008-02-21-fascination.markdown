At mid-life crossing, is it so common to have this type of inspiration? Then the topic even does not
matter anymore, it's about life methodology. A vision, is it complete? And even if not, does it matter?
I wonder if there is a  coherence between visionary ambition and overall furnishing of your lifetime.
Wouldn't it be nice if not... Then it is just a matter of finding something that interests you and keeps 
you busy (say graphic design), and don't have to worry about the social/societal value of this activity.

But, I say, to whom do you answer in that case? Obviously, to yourself. But only to the momentuous image
of yourself. Consider a person as a sum of infinite moments in time, each being a moment in it's life.
In that case, by doing this non-societal but self-sayisfying life activity, you only answer to the 
satisfaction of an individual image at one moment in the person's life. This does provide an overall
let's say 'happy' feeling on this particular moent, and if this activity is continuous and continuously
interesting or satisfying, on all of this infinite number of moments there would be a feeling of 
happiness.

But but but, if you consider a person's existence not just as individual moments, but look at a larger
number of these moments or a period if you will, the validity of an individual moment becomes relative.

So then what is there to be said about these larger considerations? That remains to be seen; because it
is perhaps impossible to neglect the individual moment. As long as people continue to live per moment, 
it cannot be forgotten. But then again, people are also able to think in larger time spans and have goals,
varying from day-to-day to multiple years. So the question remains, how does the moment relate to a 
longer spanning vision?
