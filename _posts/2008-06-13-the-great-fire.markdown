There is just a necessey for entry, got to be. Actually relevant; it has been exactly one month
since my world broke down. Or rather, went up un flames. I can still vividly remeber the day:
back and forth all the time, walking (no bike - got stuck) home to disaster site. The oceanship
has sunken.

Suprised about the continuation - of course. I'm loving it, both the renewed spirit as the diverse
new entounters and different places. May I just say it is already starting to age - that day? Is
it too early to archive? And I do love to be in the middle of it, having experienced it. Of course
entering ground zero for recovery of stuff would have been awesome; too bad that we finally had 
someone at Media who was in fact capable of organising...
