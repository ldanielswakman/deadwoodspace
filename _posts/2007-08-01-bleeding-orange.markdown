Firstly: A title does not reveal what it might suggest, given its history, about the content.
For example, it might not contain a veteran's club of some american army group. Also, an eighties
fusion-jazzband is an option of what this not is. Secondly, a title chosen earlier does not contain
what later would be considered as more suitable for the moment.

Anyway, sleep is underrated. Also the feeling of the moment versus the overall general feeling of a
time is a difference of night and day. So what is important anyway, is to be able to relate; in the
moment. But then again, should you negate current position of the mind and just plough on despite
yourself? How valuable is the you of the now? That, for example, is something that struck me today.

Just a bloopy experience, but at the same time something valuable to remember: the power of the 
powernap; completely slowed me down just now, relaxed me within. And that just with the 30 minutes
it took. Now to see how the rest of the evening will go in terms of maintaining concentration.
