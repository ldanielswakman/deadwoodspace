Welcome, do not think of going under (water) without your personal Nu-safetynet. It might as well be the last thing you ever participate in, even if you consider your monday-night yoga-classes as being educational.
So that proves our theory of the underwater, the wicked and the evil. It even states that swimming with the fishes leads to another chain-effect of falling trees on top of eachother. You can see the deserted land road, shattered with the fallen dead wood, waiting to have a car drive against them.
