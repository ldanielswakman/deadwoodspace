Welcome, the tree is no match for nightfall. Together it's teaparty. But if you want to have a home tonight, I suggest the Feeter Inn. Do not ask for their chicken though, if you feel like a good night's sleep.

And while we're talking, if you happen to see a cloaked figure sitting at the bar there, do try and ask him the correct time. Get's him going, you know. I've been there too many times to forget now...But we might want to give it a shot sometimes, and blast it all away.
