So actually, the whole crux of the matter is, simply the fact that you are not always right. For fact. But that is something that does not stick with you, because of the constant stream of arguments that you send people's way to prove you're right. That being sad, it will always be impossible to let you see that you are not always right, because you will always keep argumenting that you are right in thinking that you are right.

The thing is that the stream of arguments is strong enough to suck people in the debate of a specific case. The only way is to keep to the essence, i.e. the fact that you refuse to believe that you are always right, because you think you are always right, so also about the fact that you are right.
Another sideway for you to avoid is the discussion of 'being right'. I will just have to confront you with the fact that you think you're always right, and therefore can't be convinced of the fact that you are not right. And here, it's a cunundrum.

The only solution is to see it yourself.
