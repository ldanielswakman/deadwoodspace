So to what extent is this realism? Where does intereset become life content? Maybe
this crazy little thing called time has to have its way with it. I think it's just
useful to maintain an interest, especially when it's residing on perhaps the most
exentialistic and - apparently not unimportant - intellectual level.

And how relative or absolute is the whole notion of fascination? How would my psycho
views on the subject be if I was the underdog in the context? May I am; and there's just
some superficial distortions that cloud the truth. But, then, to what extent is this
realism, since when is the relative position not important anymore? Moreover because
up until now the divinity of the infinite relative structure has been praised. I'd
say: Just go with your instincts, go with your instincts, I might wake up soon.
