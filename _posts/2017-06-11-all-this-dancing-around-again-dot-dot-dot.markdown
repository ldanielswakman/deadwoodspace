Brandishing soldiers, many years after the wooden explusion of graveyards. Twilight hits, right before we even experienced what it is to be human. A room with a view though — could give us the arched bridges and withered masonry that she always dreamed of. But I didn't.

However, where twelve years is never enough, there's no room for thinking twice or thrice or any of those fairytales. Doorknobs and bread cases, please. She's on the sound system, ever and over.

Whoo doo youu believe to offer another solution? Can we grate the cheese ever so slightly, devoid of emotion where a good crying is highly overdue? I bet these fields of recognition have been dry for years. But new water seems to have sprung.
