A famous Barrie once said: "Longhair, how's your face, longhair how's your face". And that just opened up my world, it was groundbreaking. Nevertheless, caution should be used in the whole area of ground, the world, and the environment in general. Mostly now, when the lemons appear to be falling from the sky, and people take life as it is. Worries are rising though. Not nearly enough, if it was up to me. The question is, how to attend the people, the plebs, the mob, to the seriousness of it all? This one just shines with clich√©, but oh so true. It is definetely a matter of a change in attitude.
