Remember the e-highway crash of 2007. I just want to have a moment before the cascade descends
into the black solid earth. Then we can cover it with sand, it will be a blast. A fresh start
after a weird week of emotional unbalance.

Maybe it's just the fact of putting it all behind you, no more virtual victim search or feeble
attempts of body recovery. Then, at last, it's about being satisfied with the entities that could
be saved and composed from earlier backups. Maybe that's the best there is to it.

Oh and also; my eyes broke; had to buy new ones. But who cares; content is infinetely more
important then 40 quid of graphica.
