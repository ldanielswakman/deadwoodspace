I guess that it is safe to say, after about 5 months, that is has been a long time since some considerable bullshit has been jotted down here. Basicly, after all holiday does seem to be what It sets out to be. Just a few weeks of relaxed fun, sun, art, beautiful countries, and what not.

Even getting stung by stones can get nice. Evidence of the fun in the past weeks came in the last three days; these were thoroughly spoiled by the spiders and the dominating presence of nature. City Boys can not be trusted with such a thing. And then the sweetness of coming home after a long time, it really is undescribable. I have by the way not yet decided whether the dead wood-tendencies to contain not just bullshit and directionless words are an admirable development.

Nice words coud be, _a day in the life: purpose (structure) vs. people._
Thank you everybody. Goo'night.
