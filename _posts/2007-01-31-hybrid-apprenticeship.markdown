The first and only fulltime week is one of many different impressions. While finding a spot can be a difficult thing, and your appointed area of grass is for yourself to find and put up your tent, it can be a relieving thing to finally feel relaxed, and doing something useful.

Is that the reason why people, and by that I mean myself, often fall back or forth onto their limited qualities. Isn't the whole point to broaden your range, horizon and set of abilities?
