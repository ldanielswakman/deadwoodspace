It's just nice, you know. It turns out that even though four times as much
words are available in English than in Dutch, the word nice is omnipotent. And just
have a look at that smile, brushed face and, god love em, the vegetables.
Might not want to get carried away though, what's a compartment to a quickly drawn
image of a long train of opportunies? But then, how nice! But allright,
'whatever', I guess. Or, so as to speak: "It doesn't matter".

By the way excitement and environment are so closely linked, and the very
notion of feeling comfortable in a group dynamic is so present these days!
Could you just describe what it is, please, so I can get back to sleep? Well
maybe it just needs time to be able to reflect upon it or, you know, just
knowing that you were on the top of the hill when you are falling down into
the vally.

No history, and don't worship the supposed purity of a rush of thoughts.
