Big time waiting, or maybe just a piece of top-of-the-shelf eTrade? Best be the last one;
it took only 2 days to realise the dream, when the decision had been made. And then some
tense moments; self-realisation of conservative OS-ism. Why stop there? Why revert to old
!settings [Yes/No]? Fortunately we had a talk and some critical notes along the days. And
good ol' fortune obviously; CD's wouldn't work at moment X. And, it turns out, that it has
worked! Now used to all the glassy newness, and just had to re-explore my boundaries. This is,
as we know, no different from the old situation; just another boundarised environment, that
I got used to. Wouldn't a nomad usage be the best...
