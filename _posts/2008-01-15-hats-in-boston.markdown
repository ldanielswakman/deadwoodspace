There's a whole lot concerned with the gap between actually having the experience that
makes you so spungy and not forgetting to write about it. But then there's always the
tuesday morning 6.45 AM (0.45 in Boston)... Prevailing thoughts are how much I am
comfortable (or just medaticcaly used to it) with American culture, and how much I did
and do experience the I-want-to-go-back holiday feeling.

The aspect of new environment, high expectations, and good atmosphere leads the way for
such a heartly enclosure in people's lives and the actual appreciation of that fact.
Also to get along well with just everyone is an important factor here - like you
ever don't... But anways, realisation as always starts to kick in when it's too late, 
or in any case just on the edge, which made the past two weeks quite intense in 
boston-home-sickness. In general, it was just fucking good stuff, Thanks.
