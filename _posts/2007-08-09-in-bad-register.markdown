Twenty is a treacherous number. Especially in environments of older age. Qualities of 
interaction and life environment? Determine the conditions that make the equasion, but hey,
I'm no psychologist. Also screaming and laughing talks about sex and the altar, could be
just a fun ball game when you enter them? That part, I realised, is really a matter of
choice/lifestyle/preference. Allthough some one-hour-calling- and Wii-sessions lighten up
your vistas of thirteenth-floor-society. This aint over btw....

...And once again, is made clear that a momentary lapse of thought is subject to change with 
the ease of the weather. But no biggie, turns out good times were at hand. Left it on good 
terms, anyway.
