![The Constant Devoid of the Rational](/uploads/news_theconstantdevoidoftherational.jpg)

Hmm, quite the vibrant weekend. It has been, without at doubt, an interesting week. Quite shaken,
teaching, socialling, and stuff. Nice to remain busy, and moreover, dead at the end of the day.
And then, yes, the end of it. Fridays in the bar, just nice chatters, no fuss. And as alcohol kicks in,
things start to happen. And I think it was a bit of my own persistency in the beginning, and some of
Lot's persistency at the end, that did it. Should I have left? Perhaps. But in the end I have a sense
of looking back on it as a bit of fun, as it certainly was. Of course, the ever-clenching feeling of
being used in the social context puts somewhat of a shadow on it all.

But to what extent would that be true? Obviously, both parties are interested, and both have shown it,
end of story. And personally, my cutting it short when things were getting hot and heavy, boosted some
confidence towards the next day. The latter has been quite extremely different; nice, very nice.
