Well that's certainly a month long period of self-consultation. Somehow it's concept remained quite
clear, but the urge to jot a few words down on it was not so present. I guess because of it's personal
touch it is also not an easy writable subject.

Just to be on-topic, quick and dirty, I can say it has been interesting. It's fun to flirt, guess we all
agree on that; also the night itself in which you do nice things impulsively (of course with a little 
help from my friends the alcohol). But then this month-after period where there is sadness about the fact
that my emotional self was not in agreement with what had happened. Also would be let's say better to 
end it by saying that it won't work, but then yes, that takes this funny little thing called courage.

I guess in the end it's also rather quicklly forgotten, emotionally anyway. Always nice to have these kind
of small episodes to keep you busy, put it that way. After all, it had been a while.
