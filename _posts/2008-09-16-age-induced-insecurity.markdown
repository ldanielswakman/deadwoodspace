The pre-abroad vibrancy continues. How am I ever to attain a ready state of mind, if ever such a thing
exists? Although, fortunately, the messy feeling starts to sink, panic days are over. Soon it is time,
obviously, for addressing the inescapable issue of time; what folly! Nonetheless it boosts you in a 
general sense. Sure, the added issues of getting liked and insecurity do unbalance from time to time, 
but overall your step gets a tad bit bouncier.

Talking about the title issue now; maybe first glance impression of age isn't such a bad feeling after
all, now is it ;)? Well, of course it is, but you might admit to have discovered a new layer of
consequences, at first perhaps underestimated. Doesn't mean it changes the idea though, because even
with the above consequences, it is still a matter of see-what-will-happen. Thankfully.
