Ah, first a very necessary comment on the last sentence from before. By all means,
do worship the purity of a stroke of inspiration! The whole 90% transpiration, 10%
inspiration-thing shows us to prise these moments of motivation. How to deal with it,
though; jump out of whatever-you-are-up-to-at-that-moment, and go and express? Maybe
just having some idea and pondering over it, let it rest and all, does help it being
processed.

But yay now, gotta love pop art and the graphica of icons and cover designing. Just
having a nice time and doing lol stuff you like, not about networking, 8-hour work
load max and 'engineeringism'. It's the whole motivation thing! I'm on Michiel's
side, Nellie; on architecture, not engineering.
